Review the material in Lectures 1 and 2 and read the No Silver Bullet article available on https://software-engineer-workshop.initialcapacity.io/ website. Based on that review and your own experience, answer the questions below.

Define the term *essential difficulties* as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty.

Define the term *accidental difficulties* as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.

List and briefly describe the four essential difficulties of developing software systems that Brooks identifies. Provide additional examples of each type of the four essential difficulties.

Define what Brooks means by a *silver bullet* and reconstruct his argument as to why he believes there is no silver bullet for software engineering.
In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical  engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.

In the lecture, we discussed the importance of the following concepts to software engineers: abstractions, conversations, specification, translation, and iteration. Define each of these concepts as they are related to software engineering and discuss their importance.
